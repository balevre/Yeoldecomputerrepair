									<h2 class="major">Our Story</h2>
										<p>We started out fixing electronics issues for our family and friends, from fixing broken phone and tablet screens, to completely rebuilding computers and laptops. After several months of fixing problems for our family and friends, we decided to go into the repair business and began to fix problems for anyone that needed help. We began by working out of a car, which allowed us to meet customers at their home or office to diagnose issues and discuss repairs. We then grew to the point of working out of an apartment, because we needed a place to store computers and other electronics while we fixed them. We now operate out of a 1200 sqft shop/ warehouse, where we have plenty of space and nearly every tool imaginable to fix all sorts of problems. We still make house calls, but more often set-up appointments through telephone and our online portals.</p>
										<p>When we started our business, we made a pledge to be as affordable as possible <i>and</i> to provide the best customer service possible. The is the promise we still live and work by. Our scope of work has gotten much larger since the early days of fixing computers out of a car - we now fix everything from cell phones to game consoles to computers to small electronic appliances. We even have a small online shop where we sell numerous used and like-new electronics, from monitors and computer parts to fully functioning used computers that we have fixed.</p>
										<p>We are here for you when your warranty expires and the other repair shops want to charge you an astronomical fee for a simple repair. We hope that you will give us a call, we work hard to make sure our customers are happy. Get in touch, and find out what we can do for you. </p>
