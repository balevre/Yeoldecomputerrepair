								<h2 class="major">Our Story</h2>
									<p>We started out fixing electronics issues for our family and friends, from fixing broken phone and tablet screens, to completely rebuilding computers and laptops. After several months of fixing problems for our family and friends, we decided to go into business and began to fix problems for anyone that needed help. We began by working out of a vehicle, which allowed us to meet customers at their home or office to diagnose issues and discuss repairs. We then grew to the point of working out of friend’s apartment, because we needed a place to store customer’s computers while we fixed them. We now operate out of  a 1200 sqft shop/ warehouse, where we have plenty of space and every tool imaginable to fix all sorts of electronics. We still  make house calls, but more often set-up appointments though telephone and our online portals.</p>
									<p>When we started our business, we made a pledge to be as affordable as possible and to provide the best customer service possible. The is the promise we still live and work by.  Our scope of work has gotten much larger since the early days of fixing computers out of a car, we now fix everything from cell phones to game consoles to computers to small electronic appliances. We even have a small shop where we sell numerous used and like-new electronics, from monitors and computer parts to fully functioning used computers we have fixed.</p>
									<p>We are here for when your warranty expires and the other repair shops want to charge you an astronomical fee for a simple repair. We hope that you will give us a call, we work hard to make sure our customers are happy. Get in touch, and find out what we can do for you. </p>
